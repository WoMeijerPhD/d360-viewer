	<h1>d360 viewer</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to the d360 viewer! This is meant as a tool to enable designers to quickly and easily view and annotate 360Â° videos. It's an ongoing project that is poorly document and being done by one guy who is not really a programmer, sorry about that in advance :0!
	</p>
	<p>What is working is the viewer, you can click on one of these videos below and it should show you the video and enable you to make annotations using the '+' button.</p>
	<p>These annotations get saved somewhere to a server, still need to make the user management and flow and all that work. But yeah, it will save your data. Sorry.</p>
